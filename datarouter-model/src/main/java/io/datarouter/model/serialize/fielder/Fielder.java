/**
 * A Fielder is a mapping of java fields to the columns and cells in the storage repository. A Databean can contain
 * multiple Fielders, for example, to store a Date in different formats in two different tables, or to facilitate
 * migration from one table schema to another.
 *
 * The Fielder is usually defined in the Databean as close to the java field definitions as possible. This is to reduce
 * the likelihood that someone will add a java field and forget to add it to all Fielders for the Databean.
 *
 * Even though a Fielder is defined in a Databean, the Databean isn't aware of the Fielder until you map them together
 * in a Node.
