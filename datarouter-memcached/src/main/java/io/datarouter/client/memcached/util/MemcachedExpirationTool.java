 * specification:
 *
 * The actual value sent may either be Unix time (number of seconds since January 1, 1970, as a 32-bit value), or a
 * number of seconds starting from current time. In the latter case, this number of seconds may not exceed
 * 60*60*24*30 (number of seconds in 30 days); if the number sent by a client is larger than that, the server will
 * consider it to be real Unix time value rather than an offset from current time.
